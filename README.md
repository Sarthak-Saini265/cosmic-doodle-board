## Summary

Create a mesmerizing Cosmic Doodle Board - draw constellations with your mouse and watch them come alive!

‚ú® THE MAGIC:
As you drag your mouse across the screen, you paint with glowing stars that twinkle, pulse, and connect with thin constellation lines. It's like painting the night sky.

üåå VISUAL DESIGN:
- Deep space background: dark blue to black gradient with distant tiny stars
- When you drag mouse: leave a trail of glowing stars (like painting with light)
- Stars you create are larger, colorful, and pulse/twinkle
- Thin glowing lines automatically connect stars as you draw (creating constellations)
- Stars have different colors: white, blue, pink, purple, golden (random)
- Glow effects around each star
- Smooth particle trails follow cursor while drawing

üé® DRAWING:
- Hold mouse down and drag to draw with stars
- Stars appear along the path you drag (not just one per click)
- Each star twinkles independently with CSS animation
- Lines connect the stars in the order you drew them
- Release mouse to finish current constellation
- Start dragging again to begin a new constellation

üéÆ INTERACTIONS:
- Click and hold to draw constellation
- Release to finish constellation  
- Space bar: Clear canvas and start fresh
- C key: Cycle through color themes (cosmic purple, ocean blue, sunset pink, golden)
- Hover near your stars to make them glow brighter

üí´ MINIMAL UI (elegant overlay):
- Top center: "Draw your own cosmos" (fades after 3s)
- Bottom right corner: 
  * "Clear (Space)" button
  * Star count: "‚≠ê 47 stars"
- Color theme indicator (small color dot in corner)

üé™ BONUS EFFECTS:
- Cursor has a glowing trail while drawing
- Stars pulse at slightly different rates (natural feel)
- Constellation lines have subtle glow
- Optional: shooting stars occasionally cross the background
- When you clear, stars explode outward with animation

üå† STARTING STATE:
- Empty cosmic canvas
- Maybe one example constellation already drawn (like Big Dipper)
- Prompt appears: "Click and drag to paint with stars ‚ú®"

Vibe: Magical, creative, satisfying, like you're an artist painting the universe. Super chill and mesmerizing.
